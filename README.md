It's easy to contribute to that project, you just need to know where things are:

1. `/posts` is where all the blog posts, so you can duplicate a file and create a new project.
2. `/public`/ is where you will find all your assets like images, logos and other visual files.


## How to add a new post
1. Open the `/posts` folder
2. Create a new `.md` file. Use the already created logic `{number}-{name}` for example: `8-sedimentile`.
3. Copy the content from one of the old files into the new file
4. Replace the information in each of the fields

## How to add images
1. Open the `/public` folder
2. Create a folder with the name of your project. For example: `sedimentile`
3. Add/paste your images
4. Keep the naming convention easy and clear. And no spacing. For example: `1-sedimentile.png` or `thumbnail-large.png`
