This piece has been developed with the idea to unify two parts of a big living room space. The wave-like transitions in the geometry are nice to the eye and help reduce the reverberations of the sound waves in the space. The solid warm piece adds texture and colour to the living room. This parametric design piece is a product made of solid spruce wood which is CNC milled and painted with transparent lacquer.
