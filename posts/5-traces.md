The meeting point of the rough industrial textures found around the port and the connection between the city and water. I designed a wooden tray that resembles the shape of the numerous barges passsing through Rotterdam, which serves as the vessel that carries a set of water containers. A set of textured a small vase and a jug both containers for water currently 3D printed in PLA."
