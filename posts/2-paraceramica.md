This project investigates into production techniques for ceramics, it finds opportunity in creating endless variations of forms very rapidly. It captures the moment of surface tension and translates it to a tactile object. The tiles are slip casted in plaster molds made using a tailor made machine which saves time and
material. The added value to the product is that it can be used in a number of arrangements including complex geometrical patterns that can be made using an algorithm made for the purpose. Thanks to a flexible non-stick surface, this new tool uses numerically controlled servo motors to produce unique forms with perfect finish, posing the question of the future of ceramic design. In partnership with Cor Unum.

Tile dimensions: 10x10cm, height: 1-10cm
