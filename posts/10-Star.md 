body: "The Star vase collection of 3D printed vases is developed with simplicity in mind. Their shape gives the rigidity needed, given that they are only 1mm thick. Those vases offer an eye pleasing fluid addition to the sharp edged environment we live in. Each vase is printed with recycled plastic deriving from the Benelux region and is 100% recyclable."
